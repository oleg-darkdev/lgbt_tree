	etymology: [
		'The origins of the term twink are disputed.',
		`One possibility is that the term originates from twank, an older British gay slang term which means "the quarry of a homosexual prostitute (male); a man willing and ready to become any dominant man's 'partner'". This would date the term back to the 1920-30s.`,
		`Another possible origin of the term may be derived from Twinkie, an American snake cake. The food is described as "little nutritional value, sweet to the taste, and creme-filled"; by comparison, the young men are described as "short, and blond, and full of creme". Cream is a well-known food-related euphemistic terms for semen. Wiktionary lists this as the official etymology. This dates the term back to 1963.`,
		`Oxford Dictionaries claims twink originates from the 1950s and is related to the word twinkle.`

	shortDescription: `Twink is a subcultural term referring to gay men who defy traditional masculine roles, embracing traits that are generally seen as feminine. 
		
Twinks are typically associated with a few key tropes: general physical attractiveness, a slim build, and a youthful appearance that lacks facial hair and often body hair as well. In his book Never Enough (2007), Joe McGinniss describes a court case in which twink was defined as "a gay slang term used to denote an attractive, boyish-looking gay man between the ages of 18 and 23, slender ectomorph and with little or no body hair, often blond, often but not necessarily Caucasian."`,
