	shortDescription:
		'Polysexuality is the sexual attraction to various, but not necessarily all, genders. A polysexual person may experience sexual attraction to any number of genders, varying between (at least) two and all but one. Polysexual individuals may have a preference when it comes to which gender they are attracted to, but this is not necessarily the case.',
