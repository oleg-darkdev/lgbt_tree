	etymology: [
		`The word diamoric is a neologism from the Greek prefix dia-, meaning "passing through, thoroughly, completely, or going apart from", and the Latin word amor, meaning "love". This combination is intended to mean "love that crosses through, goes apart from, or entirely encompasses the gender spectrum."`,
		`"Diamoric" was created with a community process. It originated as "dionysian" on the social media website Tumblr in an "ask" post from the user jesse-mccree to Marlowe Lune on June 13, 2016. After that term was criticized, a public channel was created on the chat platform Discord to discuss alternative vocabulary. Lune ran a Tumblr poll on July 5 to vote between two of the proposed alternatives: appelic and diamoric; the results posted on July 14 stated that diamoric was the favored option.`,
		`While the exact word for this concept was being debated, the proposed definition for that word was: "Love or attraction of any kind for, of, shared between or involving non binary people. This includes platonic, romantic, and/or sexual love and attraction. It includes any platonic, romantic or sexual feelings or relationships an NB person has, whether with other NB people or with binary people. This word is an equivalent to sapphic and achillean but further expanded to encompass any relationship or attraction which is neither same-gender nor 'opposite-gender' due to an NB person's involvement."`

	shortDescription: `Diamoric —also known as adonian, adonic, cypric, or dionysian — is generally considered an umbrella term referring to the attractions experienced by non-binary individuals that cannot be described as "same gender" or "other gender", "straight" or "gay". As an identity word for non-binary people, it can be used to describe their sexual or romantic orientations, rather than being a specific orientation term of its own, or used to describe their relationships. Some non-binary people use it to emphasize their own gender identity and their attractions or relationships with other non-binary people. For instance, someone who is genderfluid and bisexual might describe themselves as a diamoric bisexual. Diamoric can also describe relationships in which one or more of the partners is non-binary, including relationships where one of the members is binary.`,
