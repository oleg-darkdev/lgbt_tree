	shortDescription: `One of the many long-standing gay subcultures, a bear is a large, hairy queer man who self-identifies with the 'bear' label. Being a bear combines gender expression, gender identity, and sexuality; a large, hairy straight man would not be a bear. They are generally masculine-presenting men over the age of 30 whose build may include a big belly, legs, and/or butt. Bears almost always have a full beard or facial hair, and they are often associated with so-called "traditional masculinity" or "rugged masculinity". However, there is a debate within the bear community regarding the acceptability of femininity; they tend to be contrasted with identities such as twinks and femmes. Although bears are implicitly masculine people, being a bear is not about specific mannerisms or identities like "masc", and bear identity does not indicate preferred partners or sexual roles.`,
