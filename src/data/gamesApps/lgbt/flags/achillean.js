	description: [
		`Achilles himself is a famous figure in Greek mythology. In relation to sexuality, Achilles had a relationship with another character, Patroclus, which is said to have romantic connotations. In Homer's Iliad, Achilles described Patroclus as being the "man I loved beyond all other comrades, loved as my own life." Their relationship plays a crucial part in the story. After Homer's iteration, the relationship between the men was depicted as a love affair.`,
		`The word "Achillean" has historically been used to describe all things relating to the aforementioned Achilles. An early use of the term in English to describe sexuality was in A.C. Hamilton's 1959 article titled, "Spenser's Treatment of Myth"`,
		`"Guyon subdues these Achillean affections through his own power; but they break out again as Cymochles lapses into lust and Pyrochles burns in the idle lake."`,
		`Using the term achillean in such a manner predated the reclamation of the word "gay" by the community.`,
		`The word "achillean" is often confused for gay or perceived to have the same meaning. However, gay describes a sexuality with attraction to only the same gender—men who are only attracted to other men. Achilleanism encompasses every male-based sexuality, therefore including all men, non-binary, and men-aligned people who are attracted to men. The term is meant to unite queer men.`

			'In ancient Rome and 19th century England, green indicated gay affiliations. Victorian men would often pin a green carnation on their lapel, as popularized by author Oscar Wilde. The first iteration of the achillean flag was created by Tumblr user pridenpositivity in 2016, and this version was later redesigned by DeviantArt user Pride-Flags on October 5, 2016.',
