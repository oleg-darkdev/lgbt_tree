			`The most commonly used pansexual pride flag was designed by Jasper V in 2010. It consists of three horizontal stripes: a magenta stripe at the top, a strong gold yellow stripe in the center, and a light cerulean stripe at the bottom.`,
			`Jasper V stated on their Twitter that the pride flag's meanings were intended as follows: "Pink and blue, because of their gendered traditions, and yellow, a generally non-gendered colour, to represent nonbinary folks etc."The meaning of the colors, however, is debated. Some say the pink stand for attraction to women, yellow for attraction to non-binary or gender non-conforming individuals, and blue for attraction to men. Others say that the blue, pink, and yellow stand for those who identify as men, women, and non-binary people, respectively.`
