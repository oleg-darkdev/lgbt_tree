	etymology: [
		'Maverique is a combination of the word "maverick" and the French suffix "-ique". Two definitions for maverick include "a lone dissenter [...] who takes an independent stand apart from [their] associates" and "unorthodox, unconventional, or nonconformist". The suffix "-ique" is used to form adjectives from nouns, though it had been noted that maverique can be used as both a noun and an adjective.',
		'The intended pronunciation for maverique is “mav-REEK," making it rhyme with words like “antique”.'
