	etymology: [
		`The specific acronym "MOGAI" has been attributed to a Tumblr user who is currently under the username cisphobeofficial, otherwise known as cloud, who was fourteen years old when they proposed that variation.`,
		`A group discussion began with a Tumblr post by Kay under the username okaysional (now taodefensesquad) on December 13, 2013. He said "LGBATQUI+ is trying to be all encompassing whilst getting longer every time people realise it’s missing some", but the problematic "GSM" (gender/sexuality minority) needed an alternative. Initially, he proposed MGS for Marginalized Gender/Sexuality.`,
		`Discussions quickly progressed with support for creating an alternative while critiquing MGS itself. The user robotic-fish said it was not exclusive enough since "kinksters and poly cishets will try and claim that they can use it too", sxizzor raised concerns about being "a little more inclusive of ace and queer romantic orientations", and dont-spoop-yourself noted that "marginalized gender could probably just include cishet women". Under the username sxizzor, Zach suggested using the phrase "gender alignment", saying it referred to whether or not the gender(s) someone identified as equaled their gender assignment at birth. He proposed MOGA for Marginalized Orientation and Gender Alignment; this shift also changed sexuality to orientation to be more inclusive of romantic orientations. By January 1, 2014, the further discussions had led Kay to support MOGA over MGS, in part to avoid confusion of the acronym MGS with Metal Gear Solid.`,
		`Further debate about being explicit about romantic versus sexual orientation led to several suggestions from the user mr-moon-the-cisphobic-panda, including MORSGA, which was then revised by cloud (under the username sunsetfucker) to MORSGAI on February 21. Sometime by March 16, 2014, it had been changed again to MOGAI and relayed by cloud to other Tumblr users.`
