	etymology: [
		'"Bisexual" comes from the roots "bi-", meaning "two" or "double", and "-sexual". The term "bisexuality", when referring to sexual orientation, was first used by neurologist Charles Gilbert Chaddock in his English translation of Psychopathia Sexualis in 1892, which contained a theory that the brain of a person attracted both to their own sex and the opposite sex must be partly of another sex and thus "hermaphroditic". Earlier, it was a term in botany for "having male and female parts".'
