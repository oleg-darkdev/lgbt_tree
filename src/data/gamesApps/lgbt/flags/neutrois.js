	etymology: [
		`Neutrois had limited usage prior to 2009; however, it has been suggested that the word was coined as early as 1995 by Holly A. Burnham and derived from the Latin root neuter and French trois, meaning "three". It was included under the definition of "transgender" in the 2005 book Just Add Hormones: An Insider's Guide to the Transsexual Experience. The plural form of neutrois is the same as the singular.`
