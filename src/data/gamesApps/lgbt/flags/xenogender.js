			'Multiple xenogender flags have been proposed. On DeviantArt, Roswell (under the username Pastelmemer) created two flag options on January 15, 2017. Both use the same seven stripe colors, which are described as common shades from iris flowers. The central yellow stripe symbolizes genders that have no relation to the gender binary. The symbol in the center of the designs is the astronomical sign for the asteroid 7 Iris, which is named after the deity associated with rainbows.'

	shortDescription: `Xenogender is defined as "a gender that cannot be contained by human understandings of gender; more concerned with crafting other methods of gender categorization and hierarchy such as those relating to animals, plants, or other creatures/things". Xenogender individuals may use ideas and identities outside of the gender binary to describe themselves and avoid binary gendered identifiers, such as using only their first name or the name of an animal. They may feel they cannot place a label on themselves, or feel as though they lack the terms to fully express their gender or identity, something that derives from a lexical gap. The term "xenogender" itself was designed to help fill the lexical gap by using terms not typically associated with gender or describing gender with metaphors. Since it is a gender identity that is outside the binary concepts of masculinity and femininity, xenogender is a non-binary identity.`,
